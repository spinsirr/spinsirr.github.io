## Description

Given an array of strings strs, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in any order.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Solution

This is a typical hashtable problem. What we need to do is just key the words using the its characters.

### 1. define hash table (or dictionary in python)

At first, We define hash table to index and store the words. Here we're using **collections.defaultdict()** because default python dictionary doesn't support turple as keys. And we pass in the **list** parameter to indicate the value of hash table is list.

```python
def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> list[Any, list]:
    ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
```

### 2. key the word using its characters

Here, we store the key as hashable tuple, eg. **('a', 'r', 'e')**

```python
    for word in strs:
        ans[turple(sorted(word))].append(word)
```

## Runnable codes

```python
def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> list[Any, list]:
    ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
    for s in strs:
        ans[tuple(sorted(s))].append(s)
    return ans.values()
```
