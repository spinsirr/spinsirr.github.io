#### Auto Save

Auto save is a important feature for IDEs. If you are using Jetbrain IDEs before. Then you might feel a little bit uncomfortable while using VSCode since everytime after you modify your code. You have to press **Ctrl + S** to save it. Don't worry, you can skip that by using auto save.

The auto save in VSCode is tured off by default. To enable it. We just need to click the **setting** button on the bottom left corner. Then click setting.
