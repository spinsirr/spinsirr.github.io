# We come to my personal webpage

Hi, everyone. I'm Spencer. Currently a student of [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) pursuing Master's degree of Computer Engineering.
In this website. I will post some notes while learning new technologies or maybe some fun stuff. So keep track of it.

By the way, I want to say thank you to [hexojs](https://github.com/hexojs) and [next-theme](https://github.com/next-theme) for providing such great contents to help me build this website.
